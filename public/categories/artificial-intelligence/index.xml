&lt;li&gt;Lnaguage models require vector representations of words to capture semantic relationships.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earlier than 2010s, models used word count based vector representations that captured only the frequency of words. For Example, one-hot encoding.
THe problems:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Curse of Dimensionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of meaning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, At Google, Mikolov et al. introduced Word2Vec, which used a shallow neural network to learn vector representations of words. The best part was that it could create much denser relationships between words than prior models and it was unsupervised. The training (prediction) is fake but the weight matrices we get on the side are gold mine of fine-grained semantic relationships.
There are two popular variants of Word2Vec:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The DNA of Language: A Deep Dive into LLM Tokenization concepts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have to build a house. You cannot build a stable house using only massive boulders as walls (too big), nor can you build one using only tiny pebbles (too small). You need exactly the right-sized bricks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same analogy applies to linguistics. We need to find strategies to break down petabytes of language data into usable, atomic chunks. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), these bricks are called tokens. Tokens enable us to transform a sizable amount of fluid language data into a discrete mathematical language that machines can process. It is the invisible filter at the heart of LLMs through which every prompt is passed and every response is born.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
