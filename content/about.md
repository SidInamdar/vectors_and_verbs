# Siddhesh Inamdar
**Lead Data Scientist | M.Tech, IIT Madras | BITS Goa**

I believe the most powerful data-driven solutions aren't just calculated—they’re crafted. To me, the magic happens at the intersection of algorithmic precision and creative intuition. I dedicate my time to deconstructing frameworks and exploring models, not just for their logic, but for the unique ingenuity they bring to the table. This is where I share my perspective on the technologies that are truly redefining our field.

### Expertise & Domains
* **Optimization & Predictive Maintenance:** Developed Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) optimizers and discrete programming workflows (CP-SAT) that have delivered tens of millions of dollars in annual value.
* **Deep Learning & NLP:** Experienced in deploying Large Language Model (LLM) applications using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, fine-tuned Llama models, and Langchain to automate complex business queries.
* **Time-Series & Forecasting:** Leveraged Temporal Fusion Transformers and Variational Autoencoders for high-stakes uplift prediction and sensor anomaly detection across thousands of assets.
* **MLOps & Engineering:** Specialized in building agile, production-ready stacks including **Docker, AWS Lambda, Snowflake,** and **Azure Databricks**.

## Professional Journey

### Team Leadership & Strategy
Currently, I lead a specialized data science team within the industrial machinery and energy sector. My focus is on defining deployment strategies and building agile-focused development stacks.

### Advanced Technology Development
Previously, I spent several years developing high-impact AI solutions for global energy leaders. My work involved:
* Building autonomous recommendation tools using **One-Class Support Vector Machines** to reduce human dependency in asset optimization.
* Designing **Generative AI** chatbots that allow field specialists to interact with complex optimization logs via natural language.
* Implementing **Computer Vision and Sensor Analytics** to improve production efficiency by filtering noise from thousands of industrial flowline sensors.
